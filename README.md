# programming-exercise-1

This is my web development programming exercise (1)
github name: first_web_assignment


I started doing the assignment on a different project folder rather than the original, this was due to
not understanding how github and commits worked, and so I've been working on the html and css part of my main page.

26/02/2025 I learned how to make commits and push them to my respitory on github,
this was especially hard because I had many errors come about that I couldn't understand how to resolve. The made errors were
that I forgot to commit the files after adding them, or that in the beginning I had used 'git push u- origin main'
Even though my origin was master, I learned how to check by using git branch


27/02/2025: I'm transfering the work I have done on my practice project to the main exercise,
which includes the images, background images, index html and style css for the main page and the sub pages (history and visit pages)
The main page consists of the title, navigation, search bar and a paragraph stating that this is my first web assignment 
(i will be removing the paragraph, i just have it there to see what it looks like). I have also made sure the pages are all
connected partially. the main page has nav but the other two only have links to the main page and haven't been styled
I will be working on the main page, only once I am completed with it, then will I work on the other pages.
I went back and forth on the background image, and even asked for people's opinion and finally decided to stick with a
nice houseboat with a blue background colour, the text is much easier to read and the clarity of the image but much better.
I have also added a button in the center of the page that says 'explore more..' which will lead to the history page


3/03/2025: I Created a home page and decided to make my main page my cover page.

06/03/2025: I started writing the subpages, specifically the home page including an image and the history page.
 I have't styled the yet except the naviagtion, the banner for navigation is now the same on every page. 
 I have also added a css file to each subpage. 


 12/03/2025: I created a the visit page, however looking back on the marking scheme i realised I had to use bootstrap wigdet and a 7:5
 coloumn. I didn't know exactly how to use the 7:5 ratio, i have included the card widget. I iitially wanted to use carasoul but I had a lot of difficulties.
 I am practically done with the visit page and only have the heading and little content to style. I did however forget to commit my work so i'll be doing that first thing next day
