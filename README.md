# programming-exercise-1

This is my web development programming exercise (1)
SCN: 52427129
github name: first_web_assignment


I started doing the assignment on a different project folder rather than the original, this was due to
not understanding how github and commits worked, and so I've been working on the html and css part of my main page.

26/02/2025 I learned how to make commits and push them to my respitory on github,
this was especially hard because I had many errors come about that I couldn't understand how to resolve. The made errors were
that I forgot to commit the files after adding them, or that in the beginning I had used 'git push u- origin main'
Even though my origin was master, I learned how to check by using git branch


27/02/2025: I'm transfering the work I have done on my practice project to the main exercise,
which includes the images, background images, index html and style css for the main page and the sub pages (history and visit pages)
The main page consists of the title, navigation, search bar(which does not work) and a paragraph stating that this is my first web assignment 
(i will be removing the paragraph, i just have it there to see what it looks like). I have also made sure the pages are all
connected partially. the main page has nav but the other two only have links to the main page and haven't been styled
I will be working on the main page, only once I am completed with it, then will I work on the other pages.
I went back and forth on the background image, and even asked for people's opinion and finally decided to stick with a
nice houseboat with a blue background colour, the text is much easier to read and the clarity of the image but much better.
I have also added a button in the center of the page that says 'explore more..' which will lead to the history page


3/03/2025: I Created a home page and decided to make my main page my cover page.

06/03/2025: I started writing the subpages, specifically the home page including an image and the history page.
 I have't styled the yet except the naviagtion, the banner for navigation is now the same on every page. 
 I have also added a css file to each subpage. 


 12/03/2025: I created a the visit page, however looking back on the marking scheme i realised I had to use bootstrap wigdet and a 7:5
 coloumn. I didn't know exactly how to use the 7:5 ratio, i have included the card widget. I initially wanted to use carasoul but I had a lot of difficulties.
 I am practically done with the visit page and only have the heading and little content to style. I did however forget to commit my work so i'll be doing that first thing next day


 13/03/2025: I started doing the home page. I was trying to figure out how use input a static map and what exactly they were telling me to do. After spending ages on it and even Created
 a home page 2.0 to test it on. i copied and pasted it on my actually home page, but failed. I gave up and decided i'll come back to a the end. And so i have added information on the home
 page and added some images. I created a seperate file for images i use on the visit page and another for the home page. I used devtools and visualise and find my ideal size for each picture.
 The page is ready to style which i will do another day.


 15/03/2025: I made a new discovery. infact two discoveries. The first being the reason my kerala header (h1) was different from one the visit compared to the other pages was because
the bootstrap css stylesheet was overriding visitpage css file. I realised this by reading the bootstrap css and finding a part where all the headers have a different font and size and etc.
The second discovery is how putting the exclamation mark before and after Doctype affected my website. Seen as I have been working with as Doctype!, when i realised that wasn't the correct
way to arrange it, i changed it around. however, I faced quite a few problems due to this. One of them being my cover being cut in half, i tried fixing without changing doctype but in the end
i reverted it back to how i originally spelt it. That being, said i have now competed the history page. minus the styling.  I have added a lot of information and pictures. At the bottom
of the page there are links to historical landmarks in Kerala via images. w3schools helped me learn how to caption images by using figure.


16/03/2025: I done quite a lot of adding to the css file of all the sub pages. i facea major issue where, my laptop and computer give a different outcome to what i've produced. I've been trying
to find a common ground between both devices. I did try to see if it's manageable on the phone, it is to some extent. but it could be a lot better, my commits have been very little. I've recently oly been commiting at the end of the
day instead of regurlarly, it will be a habit i'll fix another time. I have also a horrible habit of not adding comments to my work, which i plan on doing tommorow. As well as set up everything ready for submission
. Styling isn't my strong point i believe, but i also believe i've done pretty well. i faced many struggles today such as aligning images and texts it turned out i linked a page to the wrong style sheet.


17/03/2025: The final day. A lot of stress is happening right now, I managed to add a static map in the end on the home page.
I fixed up the text in the history page so it looks nice and neat. And given the images some shadows so it doesn't look plain and boring. I asked my tutorial person to help me understand how to send the
git commits as a pdf.


conclusion:

In the end. I have created a fully functional website(for laptop and computer devices) which includes a navigation bar (the search bar is for display, it doesn't work) that works.
All external links are also working. There is a load of information on each page. The home page included a static map, and the visis page includes
the bootstrap widget "card", the history page includes places to visit at the bottom. There have been regular commits however they commits were only made a the end of the day. Which needs to be fixed i the future.
I have a bad habit of not comment throughout my code instead doing at the end, which i hope to fix over my time here. There have been comments made on parts where I believe another person
reading would struggle to understand what i'm trying to do.
