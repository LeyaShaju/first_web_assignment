        <h2> History </h2>
        <p>Kerala has so much to tell in regards to it's history.The word Kerala  was created from the Malayalm word "Kera" which means coconut trees and "alam" which means land.
        This means Kerala(m) literally translates to the "land of coconut trees". The Sate played an important role in India's independance.
        By producing <b>many</b>  freedom fighters. <br> Today, Kerala is one of India’s most progressive states, known for education, healthcare, and tourism while maintaining its rich cultural heritage
        <br> The phrase <u>"God’s Own Country"</u> was also popularized as a tourism slogan in the 1980s, highlighting Kerala’s status as one of the most beautiful and peaceful destinations in the world.

        <h3>Medival period</h3>
        
        <p>The first foriegner to set foot in Kerala was "vasco Da Gama". A portuguese explorere that landed in kozhikode (also know as Calicut) in 1498. End of Medival period.
          this marked a long period of portuguese' involment in kerala in the 16th century, with the desire to control the spice trade. To be more spcific black pepper
          which was sought out be highly lucratvie. The portuguese also sought out to convert a large amount of the population, if not all,
          to Christianity by building churches and etc. This lead to a rise in Catholicism in the region. They were harsh and aggressive during their rule. They enforced strict laws and even destroyed
          sacred temples. This marked the beginning of European's domincance. By the early 1600's, the Dutch(Dutch East India Company)
          started challenging the portuguese in Kerala. By 1663, The Dutch defeated the portuguese and took of Cochin and the spice trade.  This battle was known as the seige of Cochin.

        <img src = "/historypage_images/spice_trade.jpg">

        <p>the dutch were a lot less harsh with treatment with the locals. They solely focused on the trade. The made alliances with the governers and local ruler where as the portuguese
          sought full control. They did not impose direct rule over the locals nor did the force them to convert to Christianity and so lived in harmony for the most part. Some conflict arose with
          local traders as the were angry about the Dutch monoplozing the spice trade. they had also interfered in royal succession, supporting certain rulers to protect their trade intrests.
          The rule lasted from 1663 to 1795 (132 years) before britians rule.

        <img src= "/historypage_images/gothic_church.jfif">
        <p>As stated prviously. portuguese built many churches adn with that they introduced the gothic style to architecture,. The first church build in Kodungallur(Thrissur) was 
          St Thomas Church, which holds significant hisorical importance as it was believed St Thomas (One of jesus' desciples) arrived in kerala in 52 CE. Fort Kochi, (formely known as Cochin),
          which was established by Portuguese in 1503 and later influenced by Dutch and Britain during their times of rule, is famous for it's historic buildings and landmarks imprinted by the colonizers which
          has no become a popular tourist attraction. <i>some popular places will be linked below.</i>  </p>

        <h3>Colonial period</h3>
        <img src= "/historypage_images/british_india.jpg" style= "width: 300; ">  
        <p>The decline of the Dutch's power started from their strongholds were attacked by ruler in mysore (Karnataka), ths weakened the Dutch's control. They were also
          losing profit and power in Asia from the trade.the final factor in the decline of the dutches power was the Anglo- Dutch wars. The war between britain and Dutch resulting in
          britain gaining the control of india itself in 1795. Establishing direct control over kerala. britains main focus was on governing and administration. In kerala, they had established english
          education and railways and had dveloped modern infrasturcture (railways, law systems). Britain introduced cash crops like rubber, tea, and coffee and eastblished the "British East India Company"
          for trade taking control of key ports like Cochin and Calicut. Whilst the British did not invent the caste system, they did exploit it by reinforcing social hierarchy. Higher castes had the
          privilege, while lower castes faced discrimination. After ruling for around 200 years, india finally obtained independance.
