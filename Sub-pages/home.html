            <p>If you do plan on going to Kerala when its the warmest. Make sure to go between March and May, where you can also
                celebrate "Vishu" (a hindu festival filled with Joy) and Thrissur pooram, located in thrissur. If you prefer
                not to face the raging sun try going between december and February when it's the coolest.
                There will be a lot of kathakali performances and snake boat races going on in that time.
